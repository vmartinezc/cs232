1. The PCB class is defined in calos.py
2. The PCB contains name, legal state, next PID, entry point, memory low, memory high, register0, register 1, register 2, pc, quantum (how long the process runs before being interrupted)
    setting entry point, get entry point, setting memory limits, function for setting the state, function for getting the state,
    function for setting registers, function for getting registers, function for getting quantums, function for getting PID, function for getting name.
3. A PCB is created when the PCB object is called by the load_program. Line 179 in main.py
4. The states defined have been: NEW, READY, RUNNING, WAITING, DONE
5. It has been defined in calos.py inside the CalOs class. Its significance is that it referes to the current process's PCB.
6. It is setting the number of cycles until the timer fires.
7. Once the timer has expired, don't generate another interrupt until the previous one is handled and the interrupt is reset.
