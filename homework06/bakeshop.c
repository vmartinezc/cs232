/*
    Busy Bakeshop: 
    This assignment explores concurrency and semaphores.
    The program runs several different threads. 
    The concurrent threads use semaphores to coordinate the resources in a simple bakery

    SPECS

    - Only one baker
    - Only 5 customers at a time 
    - If no one @ the cash register -> Baker can bake bread
    - If no bread when customer arrives, customer waits in the shop until more loaves
      are baked and one loaf of bread is obtained
    - Customer obtains a loaf, they pay at the cash register and wait for receipt
    - Baker receives a payment, baker issues a receipt
    - Customer can only exit after receiving a receipt
