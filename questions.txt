Question # 1
The program does not run the same way each time. This is so because the thread that gets to 
its function first and grabs the semaphore is able to execute its function first and then the 
semaphore is released for the other programs to get to the critical section.  

Question # 2
Giving the last costumer thread the highest priority does not ensure that the customer is 
always given first priority. This is so because the customer still needs to wait for the semaphores
to be released in order to be able to get to the critical section. So even though it would get to the 
function first, that doesn't ensure first priority since it would still have to wait.
